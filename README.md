## Settings Accent Icons
Have accent colored icons in Settings app in Android Pie 9 or above (Android 10 Q)

**Why though?**

In android 9 update it felt like stock android is losing its charm, its originality. iOS like recents, samsung like icons in settings, weird partition and mounting system making it harder to root.
I immediately disliked icon color change which killed my minimalistic elegant android experience.
This is just me trying to held onto.
