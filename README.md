**Why though?**

In android 9 update it felt like stock android is losing its charm, its originality. iOS like recents, samsung like icons in settings, weird partition and mounting system making it harder to root.
I immediately disliked icon color change which killed my minimalistic elegant android experience.
This is just me trying to held onto.
